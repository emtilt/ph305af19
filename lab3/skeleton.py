# Input values: define the given forces below
#force1=
#angle1=
#force2=
#angle2=

# convert input degrees to radians
# HINT: math.pi is useful!
#angle1rad=
#angle2rad=

# break forces into compoents
# HINT: math.sin() and math.cos() are useful!
#force1x=
#force2x=
#force1y=
#force2y=

# calculate magnitude of third force
# HINT: Remember that ** is the exponent symbol in python
#force3=

# determine what mass is needed to make force3
# HINT: What is g?
#mass=

# calculate angle of third force in radians
# HINT: both math.atan() and math.pi are useful!
#angle3rad=

# convert angle of third force to degrees
#angle3=

# print the two results
print(mass,angle3)
