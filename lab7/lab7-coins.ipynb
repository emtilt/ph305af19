Our experiment will launch one coin, a nickel, at another coin of unknown mass. The basic setup will look like the figure below. The $x$ axis runs along the direction of motion of the projectile; the $y$ axis runs perpendicular to that motion. Both should be clearly shown on each piece of paper used. A \"launcher\" will be built from lab items, and the coins will slide on paper (taking care the the entire post-collision tracjectory does not have to cross over edges of paper or other non-uniform features).\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-05mmxTOGLPyVdU6txQWE3zQTXx8oXgr\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"309\"/><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1PoptHGDkqcSKKzMLgXLOr9COoUFxIfry\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"/>\n","\n","We will position the \"target\" coin on another piece of paper. By tracing around the edge of the target coin and around the position that the projectile nickel will have at the moment of the collision, we can record the positions of the two coins at the moment of impact. After launching the projectile, we can record the final positions of the coins by tracing around the edges of their final positions.  We will then label and measure the distance that the center of mass of each coin traveled from the interaction point to its final position. The $x$ and $y$ components of the vector from the initial to the final position can be similarly determined. These dimensions are illustrated in the \"before\" and \"after\" pictures of a nickel-quarter collision above (the “after” image is magnified relative to the \"before\").\n","\n","We know that the mass of a nickel is:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"m5h5vQzpP4mS","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["m_nickel = 5.000 # mass of a nickel in grams"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZGipxGTEQE8V","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Therefore, if we can obtain an expression for the ratio of the masses of the two coins in terms of easily measureable distances (as sketched in the example photo), we can determine the mass of the second coin in grams.
